# üìß Spam Classifier

## üöÄ Introduction
Welcome to the **Spam Classifier** project! This application is designed to help you identify and classify emails and SMS messages as spam or not spam. Using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, it aims to improve your communication experience by filtering unwanted messages.

## üéØ Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to provide an efficient tool for users to detect spam messages, making it especially useful for individuals and businesses looking to manage their communications effectively.

## üîß Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: The app cleans and preprocesses the input text using techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
- **Vectorization**: Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical format for model prediction.
- **Machine Learning Model**: The classifier is built using a trained machine learning model capable of distinguishing between spam and non-spam messages.
- **User -Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an interactive user experience.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Tech Stack
- **Python**: The programming language used for development.
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for text preprocessing.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building the web application interface.
- **Pickle**: For loading the trained model and vectorizer.
- **Machine Learning**: A trained model for spam classification (details of the model can be added).

## üì• Installation and Setup

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-classifier.git
   cd spam-classifier
   ```

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   Activate the Virtual Environment:
   ```


3. Install Required Packages Make sure you have pip installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download NLTK Resources You need to download the NLTK stopwords. Run the following in a Python shell:
   ```bash
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   ```

5. Run the Application Start the Streamlit app by executing:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

6. Access the Application Open your web browser and go to 'http://localhost:8501' to access the spam classifier app.



## üìä Usage
1. Enter the message you want to classify in the text area.
2. Click the "Predict" button.
3. The application will display whether the message is classified as "Spam" or "Not Spam."
